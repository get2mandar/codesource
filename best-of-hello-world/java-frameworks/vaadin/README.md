# Best Of Hello World - Java Frameworks - Vaadin
Best Of Hello World: [JAVA-FRAMEWORKS-VAADIN](https://github.com/get2mandar/codesource/tree/main/best-of-hello-world/java-frameworks/vaadin) _To Be Created_

## Say Hello
[Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) is an open-source applicaiton development platform for Java. It includes a set of Web Components, a Java web framework, and a set of tools that enable developers to implement modern web graphical user interfaces using the Java programming language only, TypeScript only, or a combination of both. 

In this part of the source code, we will have vaadin platform java projects as an example, with specific build tools like Maven and Gradle etc.

## Getting Started

The sample source code is fully executable on its own based on the prerequisites are set up properly.

### Prerequisites

You are required to have few tools before you start with using the source code.
- JDK 11
- Maven or Gradle
- IDE (Recommended - Spring Tool Suite)
- Node JS
- Git

Install JDK, Maven or Gradle Build Tool, Node JS and Git as first step, before you setup the code to run.

<u>Note</u>: The Node JS is required for web components with Java in Vaadin framework example.

Make Sure the Node JS is installed on the same machine, and the Node JS files are placed in the specific folder on your machine for Vaadin to work. Without this, when you run the Spring Boot Vaading Application, you might face Node JS related errors like not able to identify the path for running command i.e. ```npm install``` etc.

Go to Node JS installation directory, and copy the folder ```node_modules``` and the ```node.exe``` into the folder ```C:\Users~.vaadin\node```.

### Get the Code

Use below URL to Clone Source Code

```sh
git clone https://github.com/get2mandar/codesource.git
```

Using the Command Line navigate to the *vaadin* folder.

```sh
cd best-of-hello-world\java-frameworks\vaadin
```

In the vaadin folder, you will see java projects with different build tools used for java i.e. *maven* and *gradle*.
